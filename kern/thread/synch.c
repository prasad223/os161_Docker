/** Reader writer locks 
Idea taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writer_lock#Implementation
and	 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readersâ€“writers_problem
This reader-writer lock implementation tries to ensure fairness between reader-starvation and Writer-starvation
scenario.
Every 2000 cpu cycles, we will let in any pending reader. This ensures no reader starvation when there are
continuous writers.

The summary below explains the idea of reader-writer locks as implemented below

Keeping the count of reader_count, writer_count & writer_request_count, we can keep track of the number of current readers, current writers,
and number of waiting writers

reader_acquire_read() :

If there is no active writer OR no waiting writer, threads can safely acquire the resource. Otherwise, all reader threads must be sent to 
sleeping state.

rwlock_release_read() :

release the resource, decrement reader_count
Due to the exclusion of reader & writer threads, it is possible that many writer thread is sleeping while  a reader is active .
Thus if reader count reaches zero, wake up all sleeping threads & exit.

rwlock_acquire_write():

Update writer_request_count
If there is no reader / writer currently present, then the writer thread can acquire the resource. Else, it must wait by sleeping in the 
wait channel till it can acquire the resource
Decrement writer_request_count
Increment writer_count


rwlock_release_write():

release the resource, decrement the writer_count
Wake up all threads when writer count reaches 0.
